Overview
This project leverages Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze Zomato restaurant data and extract actionable business insights. It addresses key questions about customer behavior, restaurant performance, and order patterns, providing data-driven recommendations for business optimization.

#Problem Statement
The analysis focuses on solving the following questions:

What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?

What is the average spending per order for couples who primarily order online?
Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum ratings?
Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, and how can Zomato use this insight to offer targeted promotions?

#Key Features
